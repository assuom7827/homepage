abstract = "A hyperbolic lattice is said to be (1.2)-reflective if its automorphisms groups up to finite index generated by 1- and 2-reflections. In this paper we prove that fundamental polyhedron of each Q-arithmetic cocompact reflection group in the 3-dimensional Lobachevsky space has an edge, such that the distance between the framing faces of this edge is quite small. Using this result we obtain the classification of (1.2)-reflective anisotropic hyperbolic lattices of rank 4."
