Since Sep 2016 am a Lecturer at the Department of Discrete Mathematics and since Feb 2017 I am also 
a Research Scientist at the Laboratory of Advanced
Combinatorics and Network Applications. My research interests include Hyperbolic Geometry, Geometry of Discrete
Groups, Coxeter Groups and Polyhedra, Hyperbolic Reflection Groups, Discrete Geometry and Combinatorics, Determinantal Point Processes.
